= NixOS installation media

The build of the ISO image is https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes[Flake based].
You will need to https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes[enable flakes] for this to work.

In order to build the ISO image, issue `./build` in a Linux shell.

In order to test it, issue `./test` in a Linux shell (https://www.qemu.org/[QEMU] with https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page[KVM] is needed)
